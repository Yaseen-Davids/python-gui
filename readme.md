These are python programs I've developed for my personal use which explains why you might not understand why I've created these.

Readme is included in each file.
Code looks like shit, not optimized but it works.
Just coded one night when the music was good and the ideas were flowing (LOL :D)

ENJOY MY LATE NIGHT CODE!
