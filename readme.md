These are python programs I've developed for my personal use which explains why you might not understand why I've created these.

Readme is included in each file.

I followed a simple rule when coding this, if it works don't touch it. Which explains why the code looks like shit.
Just coded one night when the music was good and the ideas were flowing (LOL :D)

I'll be updating it when i find good music again, unless you have any recommendations?

ENJOY MY LATE NIGHT CODE!
